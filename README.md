# 🫘 BuidlGuidl Beans - simple wallet for simple sends


```bash
git clone https://github.com/austintgriffith/beans
```

> 2️⃣ install and start your 👷‍ Hardhat chain:

```bash
cd beans
yarn install
yarn chain
```

> 3️⃣ in a second terminal window, start your 📱 frontend:

🚨 if your contracts are not deployed to localhost, you will need to update the default network in `App.jsx` to match your default network in `hardhat-config.js`.

```bash
cd scaffold-eth
yarn start
```

> 4️⃣ in a third terminal window, 🛰 deploy your contract:

🚨 if you are not deploying to localhost, you will need to run `yarn generate` (using node v16.x) first and then fund the deployer account. To view account balances, run `yarn account`. You will aslo need to update `hardhat-config.js` with the correct default network.

👀 Side Quest: we need to update this process to use node v18.x 🪄

```bash
cd scaffold-eth
yarn deploy
```
